# LVGL ported to RZ/G3E-EVKIT

## Overview

The RZ/G3E-EVKIT is a development kit for the RZ/G3E MPU. It's a SMARC v2.1 System-on-Module (SOM)
with a carrier board. It is one of the more powerful MPU boards available and has some specialized
applications in mind for use with GStreamer and electrical current measurement.

## Getting started

### Hardware setup

You will need to provide your own 65 watt USB C power supply and a Micro SD card.

- Connect SER3_UART to your PC.
- Connect the Micro HDMI port to a monitor.
- Optionally connect ethernet.
- Connect the 65 watt USB power supply to USB-C PWR IN when it's time to power the board.

### Software setup

Follow the instructions in "RZ_G3E Evaluation Board Kit Quick Start Guide.pdf"
in this repo which is from
https://www.renesas.com/en/design-resources/boards-kits/rz-g3e-evkit#documents.
It is a detailed guide for obtaining the OS image, flashing the Micro SD card, and
flashing the board's bootloader into its ROM.
This GitHub repo contains a copy of the prebuilt OS images ZIP file in the
[Releases](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_rz-g3e-evkit/releases) artifacts.
Flashing the bootloader is a bit complex
so follow the directions carefully. The guide says to use Tera Term to send files over
serial to the board. Tera Term is a Windows application. If you are using Linux, you can send
files over serial by opening the serial port with the correct baud settings at least once
and then using `cat` to send the file to the serial device. E.g. `cat file.txt > /dev/ttyUSB0`.
You may be able to keep the serial terminal open while you run this command in a separate
terminal.

You need an SDK to cross-compile applications to run on the board. When you compile an OS
image locally with Yocto, it also produces an SDK. To save you the time needed to build Yocto,
an SDK is included in the GitHub repo's
[Releases](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_rz-g3e-evkit/releases) artifacts.
It's for x86-64 architecture systems, so you will need to use an
x86-64 emulator to run it if your development PC is x86-32 or ARM based. Docker has support for emulation.
Unzip sdk.zip and execute the shell script
rz-vlp-glibc-x86_64-core-image-weston-cortexa55-smarc-rzg3e-toolchain-5.0.8.sh.
If you wish to uninstall it, simply delete `/opt/rz-vlp/` or just `/opt/rz-vlp/5.0.8`
if you have multiple SDK versions. To activate the SDK in your current terminal, run
`. /opt/rz-vlp/5.0.8/environment-setup-cortexa55-poky-linux`. It will set environment
variables like `CC`, the compiler. You can run `$CC main.c` to compile a C file that
will be able to run on the board.

### Run the project

- Clone this repository and its submodules:
  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_linux.git`
- Open the project in an editor of your choice.
- Before doing anything else in the terminal, make sure the SDK environment variables
  have been set as mentioned above. Run
  `. /opt/rz-vlp/5.0.8/environment-setup-cortexa55-poky-linux`.
- We recommend using `drm-egl-2d` config for this board. Select it by running
  The SDK includes `cmake` and `ninja` so you don't need to install them.

  ```shell
    cmake -B build -DCONFIG=drm-egl -GNinja
  ```
- Edit `src/main.c` if you want to change the default demo.
- Build the project. 
  ```shell
  ninja -C build -j$(nproc) lvglsim
  ```
- The executable is at `build/bin/lvglsim`. Copy it to the board. If ethernet is connected,
  you can do it with `scp build/bin/lvglsim root@<board ip>:/root/` where `<board ip>` is
  the IP address of the board which you find by running `ip a` on the board serial terminal.
- In the serial terminal of the board, stop the Wayland desktop, weston,
  so EGL can run directly on the display through DRM.
  Run `systemctl stop weston weston.socket` to stop weston and the weston socket.
- Run `./lvglsim` to start the app.

You can also use the wayland configuration. Select it with:

```shell
cmake -B build -DCONFIG=wayland
```

You can give `-W` and `-H` arguments to `lvglsim` to change the window size.
E.g. `./lvglsim -W 1920 -H 1080`. This project uses OpenGL ES
by default since it was found to have the best flushing performance, especially when
the refresh period is 16 ms (60 FPS target).

### Debugging

The OS image does not have `gdbserver` which is typically what you'd need to do remote
interactive debugging. You will need to build the image with Yocto and include gdbserver
in the configuration.
