  "description": "The F&S PicoCore™MX93 is a highly capable dual core compact SoM MPU (System-on-Module) which exposes abundant IO through its board-to-board mezzanine connectors. The processor is a dual-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A55. The evaluation kit comes with a 1024x600 capacitive touch display and an evaluation board for the SoM which breaks-out some common interfaces like USB, Ethernet, serial, GPIO, SD Card, and more.",
